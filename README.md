# Test_new_game - 'Among Myth and Wonder'
This is my personel project as a hobby

Started out of fatigue from modern videogames that don't satisfy me neither as an entertainment outlet nor as an art media

This project gives me a wonderful opportunity to fulfill my preferences in turn-based strategy genre and also to practice python

For now working title for this videogame will be 'Among Myth and Wonder'
