# Test_new_game - 'Among Myth and Wonder'
This is my personel project as a hobby

Started out of fatigue from modern videogames that don't satisfy me neither as an entertainment outlet nor as an art media

This project gives me a wonderful opportunity to fulfill my preferences in turn-based strategy genre and also to practice python

For now working title for this videogame will be 'Among Myth and Wonder'


# Personal milestones

Ability to save created levels and load them in a game

Created battle mechanics

Created siege mechanics

Adapted A-star pithfinding algorithm for movement both in strategy and tactical modes

There is now settlement-based economy with employed population

Layed foundations for diplomacy mechanics between realms

Found a way to convert a game into an .exe file to showcase it to other people (it was unexpectedly hard and inconvinient)
