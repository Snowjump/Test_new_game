# Test_new_game
This is my personel project as a hobby
Started out of fatigue from modern videogames that don't satisfy me neither as an entertainment outlet nor as an art media
This project gives me a wonderful opportunity to fulfill my preferences in turn-based strategy genre and also to practice python

I have find out that it is really hard to come up with a good name for my videogame, therefore any names used at this point are just placeholders


# Personal milestones
Created level editor
Ability to save created levels and load them in a game
Created battle mechanics
Created siege mechanics
Adapted A-star pithfinding algorithm for movement both in strategy and tactical modes
There is now settlement-based economy with employed population
Layed foundations for diplomacy mechanics between realms
Utilized images and sounds
Found a way to convert a game into an .exe file to showcase it to other people (it was unexpectedly hard and inconvinient)
